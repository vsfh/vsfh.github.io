<h1>Providing six more feature extraction algorithms for biomedical images with pyHIVE 2.0</h1>

</div>
<p>pyHIVE is a health-related image visualizationand engineering system using Python</p>
<p>My first research experience is about upgrading pyHIVE</p>
<h2>experience</h2>
<p>Before my sophomore summer vacation, I don't know nothing about Bioinformatics, nor getting well research trainging. At the end of that semester, One of my teacher sent me an email and said there are a sharing session about studying abroad in her lab that maybe I interested. I was free that time so I participated.
</p>
<p>I was looking for an opportunity to fill my research experience that time. After that meeting, I talked with the professor in charge of the laboratory for a while. He told me that there is a medical image analysis software that needs to be upgraded. If I can add some more accurate algorithms and upgrade related functions, he will be glad to give me this opportunity.
</p><p>
So I started working with the teacher who sent me the email. I didn't learn python at that time. In fact, looking back now, it was a mess at the beginning. We ran the program on the CPU of our laptop. At that time, I knew nothing about virtualenv, which caused a lot of trouble for my later thesis writing.In fact, a lot of troubles are caused by the lack of design in the beginning. It does not mean that we have a clear software function goal, which means that we do not need to design the experimental process. But fortunately, after a series of messing up and waiting anxiously, I also developed the ability to withstand stress. Halfway through the experiment, I had new ideas. Through this, I developed the ability to multi-thread processing (and the ability to withstand double pressure)
</p><p>
Finally, I successfully added six new feature extraction algorithms to the original software, and achieved better accuracy than the original algorithm on the gastroscope data set. I also added a feature screening mechanism to the original software, integrating feature data obtained by two different extraction algorithms through the ttest method and filtering them by randomly removing one of the columns.
</p><p>
From start to finish papers I spent half a year, now I probably already familiar with this process,and can avoid a lot of detours.</p>
