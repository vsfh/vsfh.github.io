I am currently a software engineer at [Chohotech](https://www.chohotech.com/zh.html#/).

I got my bachelor's degree in software engineer from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/en/) in 2021. In summer and fall 2020, I interned at [Mississippi State Univ.](https://www.missouristate.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiqian Chen](https://imczq.com/). At the same time, I interned at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Liu](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/jun-liu2) and [Prof. Ping Hu](https://feinanshan.github.io/) in [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).



Research Interests
======
My research interests are computer vision and computer graphics. Most of my work aim to capture and analyze the geometry, motion and appearance of dynamic and deformable objects, including human teeth and face as well as general objects and scenes.
