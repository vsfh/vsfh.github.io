The neural network and quantum computing are both significant and appealing fields, with their interactive disciplines promising for large-scale computing tasks that are untackled by conventional computers. However, both developments are restricted by the scope of the hardware development. Nevertheless, many neural network algorithms had been proposed before GPUs become powerful enough for running very deep models. Similarly, quantum algorithms can also be proposed as knowledge reserves before real quantum computers are easily accessible. Specifically, taking advantage of both the neural networks and quantum computation and designing quantum deep neural networks (QDNNs) for acceleration on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors is also an important research problem. As one of the most widely used neural network architectures, convolutional neural network (CNN) remains to be accelerated by quantum mechanisms, with only a few attempts have been demonstrated. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical circuit, namely Quantum Fourier Convolutional Network (QFCN). Our model achieves exponential speed-up compared with classical CNN theoretically and improves over the existing best result of quantum CNN. We demonstrate the potential of this architecture by applying it to different deep learning tasks, including traffic prediction and image classification.
